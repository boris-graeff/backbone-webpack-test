# My sample weather app  

Sample weather SPA to test Webpack. Grunt - Browserify duo is replaced by Webpack.

- Backbone
- Webpack
- Handlebars

Test basic features : routing, API calls, rendering, ...

The user type a city name on the first page then the weather information is displayed on another page. I use OpenWeatherMap API : http://openweathermap.org/api.

Add flat design with weather icons font : https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/
